                The head of the Observatory, Edward Pickering, needed someone to crunch the astronomical numbers in order to calculate relationships and effectively measure the universe. Men reportedly turned down their noses at this "clerical" work. So Pickering asked his housemaid, Williamina Fleming, to work as a "computer" at Harvard.

            Fleming agreed, going on to lead a team of more than 80 women who did the computational work that's responsible for how we understand the universe today.

                  "The mother of computing" also got her start in the military. 
                  In the late 1940s, Grace Hopper worked at the Harvard Computation Lab as part of the Navy Reserve, programming the Mark 1 computer that brought speed and accuracy to military initiatives.
                  Later, she transferred to the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corp, where she worked as a senior mathematician. She helped develop the UNIVAC I computer, the first business-oriented machine.

                The VFX industry is a notorious boys' club, but one person who's championed and innovated it from the beginning is the VFX producer Victoria Alonso.

                Alonso is now Marvel Studios' executive vice president of physical production. She has overseen the effects for many of the movies in the Avenger series, Guardians of the Galaxy, and many more. Alonso started her career as a production assistant, working her way up to be one of three top dogs at Marvel. She's a boss lady if we've ever seen one.

                Williamina Paton Stevens was born in Dundee, Scotland on 15 May 1857, to Mary Walker and Robert Stevens, a carver and gilder.There, in 1877, she married James Orr Fleming, an accountant and widower, also of Dundee. She worked as a teacher a short time before the couple emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, US, when she was 21. The couple had one son, Edward P. Fleming.
                After she and her young son were abandoned by her husband, Williamina Fleming worked as a maid in the home of Professor Edward Charles Pickering, who was director of the Harvard College Observatory.
  
                Pickering's wife Elizabeth recommended Williamina as having talents beyond custodial and maternal arts, and in 1879 Pickering hired Fleming to conduct part-time administrative work at the observatory. In 1881, Pickering invited Fleming to formally join the HCO and taught her how to analyze stellar spectra. She became one of the founding members of the Harvard Computers, an all-women cadre of human computers hired by Pickering to compute mathematical classifications and edit the observatory's publications

                  Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and the FLOW-MATIC programming language she created using this theory was later extended to create COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.
